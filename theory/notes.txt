- poor results for 20.000
- this vs genetic algorithm z

- \cdot VS \times VS "*"
- \input == #include

- interpretation after result \ subsection of the results
- mla  = modern language association 

- about parallelism:
	- smallest things
	- waitable things
	- maybe one iteration of hillclimbing

- time limits 
	- LLONG_MAX == 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
	- nanoseconds
		- 9,223,372,037s
		- 153,722,867m
		- 2,562,047h
		- 106,752d
	- if the time is represented in nanoseconds and the algorithm runs for more than 106,752 days, it is a overflow
	? if the time is represented in seconds and the algorithm runs for more 106,752 days; is it the same case?
